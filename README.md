# Ephaptic Field Intelligence Tools

This repository contains three groundbreaking Python applications demonstrating novel physics-inspired computing:

- **Instaton Image Storage System**
- **Live Instanton Viewer**
- **Field-Driven Particle Simulator**

Unlike traditional AI or quantum computers, these tools simulate *ephaptic field coupling* â€” where "instantons" (field entities) evolve through mutual interactions in a 2D wavefield to store, process, and recall information. No neural networks, no training â€” this is emergent intelligence in action.

## ðŸ§  1. instanton_image_storage.py

A full GUI application that stores grayscale images into stable field configurations using ephaptic dynamics.

### Features

- Load and compress any image (resized to 128x128)
- Store as a unique stable configuration in a complex field
- Retrieve and display stored image
- Show field structure (amplitude visualization)
- Save/load compressed field configurations (via `.pkl`)

### Run

```bash
python instanton_image_storage.py
```

---

## ðŸŒŠ 2. live_instanton_viewer.py

A dynamic simulation of instantons in a 1D substrate. Visualizes:
- Field amplitude evolution
- Ephaptic coupling field
- Instanton positions and phase behavior
- Real-time Bell correlation estimates

Used to demonstrate emergent entanglement-like behaviors in classical simulations.

## ðŸŒ€ 3. anttis-instanton.py

A real-time 2D PDE-based field simulator.

### Features
- Models a particle-like disturbance (instanton) sailing on a wave substrate
- Mexican-hat potential field dynamics
- Particle wake and center-of-mass tracking
- Animated visualization

Used to intuitively understand field-particle interactions.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

See `requirements.txt` â€” these tools work on basic Python installs with popular scientific packages.

## ðŸ“‚ File Formats

- Stored configurations are `.pkl` files containing the entire stable field and metadata (position, phase, etc.)
- Images should be standard grayscale `.png`, `.jpg`, `.bmp`, etc.

## ðŸ’¡ Background

This project explores whether field-based computation can perform tasks typically requiring machine learning. Early results show:

- Data is stored through emergent field dynamics
- No training or weights needed
- Information is encoded topologically and phase-wise
- Fields can "recall" stored data via retrieval

We believe this represents a new computing paradigm: **Ephaptic Intelligence**.
